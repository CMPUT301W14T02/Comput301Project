	You will be brought to a page where you can view 
	the comment's replies, 
	its picture if it has one, 
	reply to the post, 
	favorite the post, 
	or follow the comments author. 
	Additionally, if you are the author of the selected comment you can edit the comment through the action bar option on that page.
